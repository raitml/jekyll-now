This page hosts the Machine Learning focused student group at RAIT. We are a bunch of students interested in AI and looking forward to colloborate together on the same. 

### More Information

We focus on Machine Learning and Deep Learning and our primary goals are to stay up to date on SoTA research and also to provide a platform where people can come in and discuss ideas and learn from each other. We are also planning to organize workshops and 101 seminars that help the student population here at RAIT get started with Machine Learning.
